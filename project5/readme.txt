This is my attempt. I implemented functions, loops, if statements,
basic expressions.

I was not able to implement classes, calls, and variables.
I was having a hard time implementing variables.
I am not sure why. It could be because of the offset. Yet, nothing works.
Because of that, I was not able to implement classes, function calls, arrays,
and field access. :(
